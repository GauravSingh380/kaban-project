That’s a **great choice**—task/project management tools (especially with **role-based access**) are in constant demand and have strong monetization potential.

You're targeting a **multi-role Kanban-style collaboration tool**, so let’s break down the entire **feature list, pages, planning**, and **MERN-specific structure** for this app.

## ✅ **Project Name Suggestion (Optional)**

Something like:
**TaskNinja** | **FlowBoard** | **KanTrack** | **PlanWise** | **WorkLoop**
